# Virtual Environments  <a name="virtual_env"></a>  

I prefer to use Pipenv which is a tool that simplifies Python dependency management by automatically creating and managing virtual environments for your projects. It combines the functionality of pip and virtualenv into a single package, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure project consistency.


- **Installation:** Install Pipenv using pip:
  if you already have pipenv jump this one
  ```bash
  pip install pipenv
  ```
  
- **Creating a Virtual Environment:** Create a virtual environment for your project:
  ```bash
  pipenv install
  ```
